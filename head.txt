1 New Delhi: Congress general secretary Shakeel Ahmad on
2 Saturday targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party again on Twitter.

4 the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the authenticity
5 of the letter apparently signed by 65 Indian MPs against Gujarat Chief
6 Minister Narendra Modi.

8 The controversy around the letter seeking denial of US visa to Gujarat
9 Chief Minister Narendra Modi deepened earlier this week, as many MPs whose name appears on it said they did not sign any such letter. The Congress said it 
10 has nothing to do with the controversy. 
11 BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar had called the letter "a dirty trick" 
12 by the Congress. BJP MP from Jharkhand's Lohardaga Sudarshan Bhagat, meanwhile, wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar urging her for a probe into the 13 13 alleged forgery.

15 The letter was dispatched to both the US President and the British Prime
16 Minister in 2012. A copy of the letter was resent to the White House this
17 week after BJP president Rajnath Singh asked the government there to issue a visa to Modi.
