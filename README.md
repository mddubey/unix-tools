## head:
#### Head gives the first `n` lines from the given files.
    * sd_head.sh filename

## tail:
#### Tail gives the first `n` lines from the given files.
    * sd_tail.sh filename


## sort:
#### Sorts the lines in a file.
    * sd_sort.sh Filename

## uniq:
#### Filters out the adjacent  repeated lines in a file.
